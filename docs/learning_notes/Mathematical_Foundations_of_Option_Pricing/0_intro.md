## Introduction

A **financial derivative** is defined in terms of some underlying asset which already exists on the market.

A derivative cannot therefore be priced **arbitrarily** in relation to the underlying prices, if we want to avoid mispricing between the derivative and the underlying price.

We thus want to price the derivative in a way that is **consistent** with the underlying prices given by the market.

We are not trying to compute the price of the derivative in some "absolute" sense. **The idea instead is to determine the price of the derivative in terms of the market prices of the underlying assets.**

## Assumption: frictionless markets

We will specify a set of basic tradeable assets and a set of times. At any such time, each basic tradeable asset has a market price, and we can buy/sell/hold arbitrary quantities at that time, at that price. In other words, assume frictionless markets. In particular, we assume

- No transaction costs: no commissions, no fees, no taxes
- No bid-ask spread. No slippage. No market impact
- No default risk. No counterparty risk
- No margin constraints
- Can hold fractional quantities of assets
- Can sell what you do not own (sell short or go short or short), and hold a negative quantity (a short position)
