## 零、

The purpose of this introduction is to give a few examples of applications of the two main types of **matrix computations**: **solving linear systems of equations** on the one hand, and **computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors** on the other hand.



## 一、Discretization of a Differential Equation

用来计算微分方程的数值解。



## 二、Least Sqaures Fitting

最小二乘拟合。



## 三、Image Compression by the SVD Factorization

通过奇异值分解，做图像压缩。
