During my time at UChicago, besides from my major courses, I also take courses in finmath, like stochastic calculus, statistics of high frequency data

let me stop here if you have any question

Then let's talk about the professional experience.
At April this year, I joined a school project that was held by UChicago and DRW holdings, and it's mainly about trading volumes prediction. In that case, as one of the math major student in the group, I designed  a mechanism of outliers' regularization to  improve prediction, and I also take responsibility of 80% coding work. This project lasted for two months.

Speaking of internship, I have a four month internship of investment assistant at spectrum investments. It's a small fund, so I get to directly work with the boss. In that experience, I mainly did two things. The first one is I constructed a CTA trading strategy, I inplemented and backtested the strategy on Chinese future market. I also used my math knowledge to optimize the parameters, thus improved the performance. The second thing is I introduced and built the pipeline of generating daily products for sale and also for internal usage, which is highly efficient compared to before. I got appraised a lot for doing this.
In my undergraduate, I have done for more than three school projects, and I only listed related one here, which is about interest rate prediction.

怎样了解到这个工作的

### How you handled a difficult situation

/ challenging point

time was againest you, had to work very quickly or multitask to achieve your goal

用STAR，situation you were faced with, task that needed doing, action you took to achieve the task, results following your actions
如何解决问题的，规划时间 key activity   prioritize   做了一个详尽的tracker, 分工spread sheet
cooperate with the team

A valued menber of staff went off sick for a week. This was a difficult situation because their work was integral to the project we had bean working on. Now the easy thing would have been to extend the project deadline, but I wasn't prepared to do that. I decided to assess my co-workers duties and after doing so I felt that I could absorb most of their work. For the areas of their work I wasn't qualified to undertake, I found an online contractor who I hired to complete their tasks. Although this was a difficult time sensitive situation to deal with, by remaining calm , assessing my options and using creative thinking, I was able to find a solution.




### 如何handle difficult colleage, boss：

直接举例，有一个school project，有个人不是很active，
第一步，跟老师聊，escalate risk 传达，要跟他讲可能做不完了，看是否需要改timeline
第二步， in the meanwhile 先聊一下，试图去了解他的concern，去clarify 项目的目标和锻炼，一块儿分担一点
最后解决了！（除非真的这么问了，最后没给credit

如果有人disagree with your opinion:
还是举例子
