The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them.

Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There's no other way off.

My advice -- Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.
